            "answer": "If you’re planning on writing code during ADI Labs, you should have experience with web apps or mobile apps. For web developers, you should understand how a framework like Flask, Django, or Ruby on Rails works and be able to build a simple website using one of them. For mobile, you should be able to get a simple app up and running. In deciding projects, we will try to put you on a project that matches your skill level."

Labs is about you learning and building cool stuff whereas Committee organizes events for the student community. If you’re interested in joining Committee, sign up for the ADI Newsletter on <a href='https://adicu.com'>adicu.com</a>."

            "answer": "Yes! ADI Labs is structured to help you achieve your goals and finish a real project. If you already have one in mind, let us know what your idea is in the application. Make sure to flesh out your idea and how you can accomplish it; the more detail the better! However, it is not guaranteed you will get to work on the project you propose."
